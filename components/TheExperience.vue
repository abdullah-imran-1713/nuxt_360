const experience: Ref<HTMLCanvasElement | null> = ref(null); // The line const experience: Ref<HTMLCanvasElement | null> = ref(null); declares a reactive reference to a canvas element in a Vue component, starting with a null value.

// Other than destructing syntax we can also use this way:

This aspect ratio is then used to ensure that the Three.js camera and renderer are correctly configured whenever the window size changes, providing a responsive 3D scene.
// The function passed to computed returns the result of width.value / height.value, which calculates the aspect ratio of the window
//Dependence on useWindowSize: Since width and height are reactive references provided by useWindowSize, any change in the window size triggers a recalculation of the aspect ratio.
